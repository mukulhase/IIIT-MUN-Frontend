				Model United Nations (also Model UN or MUN) is an academic simulation of the United Nations that aims to educate
    participants about current events, topics in international relations, diplomacy and the United Nations agenda.

    The participants role-play as diplomats representing a country or NGO in a simulated session of a committee of the
    United Nations, such as the Security Council or the General Assembly. Participants research a country, take on roles
    as diplomats, investigate international issues, debate, deliberate, consult, and then develop solutions to world
    problems. More recently, simulation of other deliberative bodies, such as the United Nations Security Council, has
    been included in Model United Nations, even if they are completely unrelated to the UN or international affairs as a
    whole.
