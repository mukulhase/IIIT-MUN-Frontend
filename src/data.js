Greetings,\
</p>\
It is my utmost pleasure to welcome you to the 3rd edition of IIITH-MUN, from 27 January to 29 January, 2017 at IIIT Hyderabad. IIITH-MUN aims to offer a platform where you can meet a number of talented delegates, and debate on a diverse range of problems relevant on the global scale.\
<p>\
IIITH-MUN intends to promote healthy debate, deliberation and cooperation. As you battle it out (intellectually, of course) with the rest of the delegates, IIITH-MUN will expose you to a host of world problems - not just those we face currently, but potential ones that can arise in the future too. It will challenge you to design solutions in a diplomatic manner, through continued discussion and cooperation with delegates representing other countries. \
</p>\
<p>\
This year, we will be hosting the MUN in partnership with CID (Conclave of International Diplomats), an organization which is an independent body of young enthusiasts hailing from various professional and non- professional backgrounds who aim to involve Indian youth to participate and bring out their talents. We hope that you take away more than just the memories of the MUN after it's done - valuable experience in diplomacy, better debating skills and a more open mind towards finding cooperative and synergistic solutions to diplomatic issues.\
</p>\
<p>\
We hope to have an enjoyable and exciting IIITH-MUN, and look forward to welcoming all of you in January 2017.\

Anna Lindh\
The UN Security Council is one of the six principal organs of the UN, tasked with the maintenance of international peace and security, as well as accepting new members to the UN and approving any changes to the United Nations Charter. It’s powers include the establishment of peacekeeping operations, imposing international sanctions, and the authorization of military action through resolutions. It is the only committee that is capable of issuing binding resolutions to member states.\'\
At IIIT-H MUN 2016, FSC delegates will be taken a few years into the future, to discuss and resolve issues that a potential Security Council of that time would deal with. This committee will allow each delegate to test both their deductive and imaginative skills, and to create solutions to problems that generations of the future will have to eventually face, and resolve. \

\
\
The Disarmament and International Security Committee (DISEC) is the First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly. It deals with disarmament and threats to global peace. In light of the events in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the first resolution by DISEC was created in 1946 to address international concerns for the “Establishment of a Commission to Deal with the Problems Raised by the Discovery of Atomic Energy.”\
DISEC is perhaps one of the most important General Assembly committees, and it is the only one other than the Main Committee of the General Assembly entitled to verbatim records coverage. \
\
\
As DISEC members, delegates will debate and discuss about a wide variety of arms- and security-related issues, and pass resolutions that would help to make the world a safer and more peaceful place.\

The Human Rights Council is an inter-governmental body within the United Nations system responsible for strengthening the promotion and protection of human rights around the globe and for addressing situations of human rights violations and make recommendations on them. It has the ability to discuss all thematic human rights issues and situations that require its attention throughout the year. The Council is made up of 47 United Nations Member States which are elected by the UN General Assembly. \
 \
The UN HRC deals with topics that revolve around Human Rights violations - such as discrimination against minority groups, abuse of human rights, and human rights during conflict. It abides by the many different human rights conventions, and works with special rapporteurs and working groups to investigate human rights violations, and to keep states in check. \

“Working together to take action against drugs, crime, corruption and terrorism, we can increase security and improve the lives of individuals, families and communities all over the world."\
UNODC Executive DIrector, Yury Fedotov\
\
\
A unique and specialised committee, the UNODC deals with the global fight against illicit drugs and international crime. It combats certain specialised problems faced by the international community, such as: organised crime and trafficking, crime prevention, crime prevention and criminal justice reform, drug abuse prevention and terrorism prevention.\
\
\
Due to the broad scope of its work, the UNODC operates through all the regions of the world through an extensive network of field offices. It works via three main channels - field-based cooperation projects to help states combat the above problems, research and analytical work that provides a solid theoretical base for policy decisions on the above topics, and assisting states in the ratification and implementation of international treaties.\
\
\
As UNODC members, delegates will confront problems specific to drugs and crime prevention, looking at these topics both from the national and global point of view, and be challenged to devise policies and solutions that would be relevant and implementable in today’s world.\
